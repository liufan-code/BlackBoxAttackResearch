# BlackBoxAttackResearch
This repository is dedicated to the study and testing of Black-box Attack Methods. It includes the implementation of a training surrogate model executed black-box attack method, utilizing SMOTE technology for data augmentation. The experiment analyzes the obfuscation effectiveness of this strategy on different machine learning models and shows the best obfuscation effect on LSTM models, while CNN models exhibit strong robustness against such black-box attacks.

## Features
- Implementation of black-box attack methods
- Use of SMOTE technology for data augmentation
- Evaluation scripts to test obfuscation effects on various models

## How to Use
Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for detailed instructions and usage information.
